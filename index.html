        <h2>Thank you for your interest in Good Neighbors!</h2>
        <p> There are just a couple quick steps to get started:</p>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to <a href="https://beakerbrowser.com/install/">Beaker Browser's Install Page</a> and select the version that matches your system.<br>
                Good Neighbors is a special kind of website called a Hyperdrive, and it <b>Will not work when viewed on any other web browser.<sup>*<sup></b>
                </li>
                <li>After your download finishes, go ahead and install Beaker.<br>
                    Your computer or antivirus might give a warning about an unverified publisher. This is because Beaker is not currently on any App stores.
                    On Windows, click "More Information" and then "Run anyway." Beaker is safe to use.</li>
                    <li>Set up your <em>Beaker Profile</em> when prompted after opening Beaker for the first time.</li>
                <li>Finally, copy the <b>Good Neighbors Hyperdrive link</b> into your Beaker browser address bar.<br>
                    <button onclick="copyHyperdriveLink()">Click To Copy: </button> <pre id=gnl>hyper://436fc8f73894f96276444f429d586e5cdbe21cb029e404bf564122a93e4693e0/</pre>
                </li>
                <li>We recomend bookmarking Good Neighbors, and pinning it to your start page for easy access.</li>
                <li>Enjoy getting to know your neighbors!</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>* Beaker Browser is a Peer to Peer web browser, just like Google Chrome or Firefox, 
        but with the cabability to share Hyperdrives between users. This means that if I want to see a Hyperdrive website, Beaker can get 
        it from a user that has already visited the site, in addition to going directly to the source. Hence, "Peer to Peer" or p2p. Good Neighbors relies heavily
        on Beaker's p2p features, and would not work without it.</p>
    </div>
    <script>
        function copyHyperdriveLink() {
            const el = document.createElement('textarea');
          el.value = "hyper://436fc8f73894f96276444f429d586e5cdbe21cb029e404bf564122a93e4693e0/";
          document.body.appendChild(el);
          el.select();
          document.execCommand('copy');
          document.body.removeChild(el);
        }
    </script>
